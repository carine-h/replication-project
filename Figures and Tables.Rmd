#Table 1 - Regression Results
# In the table in the paper, the authors use the ordinary least squares regression model
# Support is for support of the policy
# These interaction models are used because people who strongly identify as conservative, for example, are more likely to be in the Republican party.
# Since I am trying to best replciate Table 1, I used the same regression components. I also kept the data parametes the same because these seem to be key in identifying which subjects we are looking at. I am still trying to find a way to better understand each variable (I may even email these authors) because there is no exhaustive list. To stay safe, I left the data parameters as they were.
# Interacting knowledge with political cues as well as key control variables:
# this model looks at the interaction between political knowledge and conservative/liberal cues

# The outcome of Model 1 tells us that those with more political knwoledge are less likely to respond to liberal or conservative cues.

It is important to note that what is being plotted is the coefficient of cues (contrump, libtrump, gopleader).
I found one mistake - the cofficient for Republicans in Congress on the Republican subset is displayed as about -0.03 probability of voting for liberal policy while the regression tells us that it is actually about 0.008.

# This code will culminate in plot that looks at the treatment effect (political cue) on those with varying ideologies. 
# The hypothesis here states: Self-described conservatives should hold firm to their presumed beliefs and are less likely to be party loyalists because they stick with their self-described policy tenets.
# The steps here are the same as those above, just using ideology. I will not go through each in detail.
