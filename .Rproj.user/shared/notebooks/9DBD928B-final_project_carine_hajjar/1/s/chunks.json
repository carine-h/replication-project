This differs Barber and Pope's figure 2 because it tests the effect of Trump cues on different levels of Democratic partisanship rather than among Republicans. The left panel represents a conservative cue and the right represents a liberal cue. The effect of the cue is the coefficient extracted from a linear regression that uses conservative (or liberal) Trump cues, partisanship, a racial control to predict support for a policy. The vertical axis represents the increased probability of voting for a liberal policy. Positive values indicate a liberal shift while negative values indicate a conservative shift. The horizontal axis represents increasing partisanship. The black bars represent the 95 percent confidence interval for each predicted treatment effect. The figure shows that Republicans with stronger partisanship are most likely to support a Trump cue, whether conservative or liberal.","fig.height":4,"fig.width":6.500000000000000,"label":"unnamed-chunk-1"},"row":366,"row_count":1,"visible":true}],"chunk_rendered_width":700,"default_chunk_options":{"echo":false,"message":false},"doc_write_time":1588968597,"working_dir":null}
